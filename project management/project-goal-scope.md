# Project Goal and Scope for BugTrackr

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a user-friendly bug tracker 
web application that enables efficient bug reporting, tracking, and resolution, 
providing a collaborative platform for project stakeholders and ensuring improved 
software quality and timely bug resolution.

## Project Scopes
- Bug Tracking System: The primary objective of the web app is to provide a robust 
bug tracking system to manage and monitor software bugs reported by users or team members.

- User Management: Implement user authentication and authorization functionality 
to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. The system 
should differentiate between different user roles, such as administrators, project 
managers, and developers, with varying levels of access and privileges.

- Bug Reporting: Enable users to submit bug reports through a user-friendly interface. 
The system should capture essential details such as bug description, severity, priority, 
attachments, and associated project information.

- Bug Assignment and Workflow: Implement a mechanism for assigning bugs to developers 
or teams. The web app should facilitate the tracking of bug progress through 
various stages, such as open, assigned, in progress, resolved, and closed.

- Bug Prioritization and Severity: Allow users to assign priorities and severity 
levels to reported bugs based on their impact on the project. Implement a mechanism 
to highlight critical bugs that require immediate attention.

- Communication and Collaboration: Enable communication and collaboration among 
team members regarding bug resolution. Include features such as comments, notifications, 
and status updates to keep stakeholders informed about bug progress.

- Reporting and Analytics: Provide comprehensive reporting and analytics features, 
including bug statistics, trends, and performance metrics. Generate graphical 
representations to visualize bug data for better analysis and decision-making.

- Integration and Compatibility: Ensure compatibility with various web browsers and 
operating systems. Consider integrating with popular project management tools, 
version control systems, or development environments to streamline bug tracking and 
enhance productivity.

- Mobile Responsiveness: Develop a responsive user interface that adapts to different 
screen sizes and devices, ensuring optimal user experience across desktops, laptops, 
tablets, and mobile phones.

- Documentation and Support: Create comprehensive documentation and user guides to 
assist users in utilizing the bug tracker web app effectively. Provide ongoing 
technical support and address user queries or issues promptly.
