- I've completed learning basics of HTML
- Now, I want to build the basic structure of the web app
- basic information like app name - app name will be BugTrackr
- domain address is bugtrackr.com
- Now, i am trying to plan what are the pages involve and how the backend data
would look like - at least get the basics right
- i'm not even start building all the stuff but i started to feel this going to
be hard, but i will push through. i will - mark my word!
