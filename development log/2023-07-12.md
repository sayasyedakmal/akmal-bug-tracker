- I have to keep pushing through
- It hit me again - the feeling of giving up this endevour or this journey
- Reason it hitting me:
    - this efforts require to much of my focus and brain power - causing me to drop
    any other efforts to focus on other thing in my life, such as:
        - managing family matter,
        - resolving 'urusan tukar nama harta ummie dan abah - felcra dan tanah pusaka',
        - bayar hutang emak mertua yang berjumlah RM 30,000
        - the urges to start something else in order to bring money to the family
- the reason i have this kind of pressure is due to uncertainty of my current employment
- after talking to my wife and do some self reflect, i now understand that it shouldn't be
that way
- what I will do:
    - I will do some changes on how i approach this project
    - I will set reminder and write down on all the things that i need to do or manage
    so that i won't forget or left undone. what needs to be done has to be done
    - my focus now is:
        - learn as much as I can and build something quickly - don't worry about
        the methodologies or planning to much in detail - just make stuff quickly
            - in this case, program everyday
        - the knowledge will be the most valuable - learn it first and plan later
        on how my career will look like next year.
        - i can do a lot of things with the full-stack web development knowledge
            - create my app and sell it
            - create a startup based on my app
            - create my own business
            - selling course and teach online
            - do freelancing
            - etc..
- new approach of this project
    - this project will be a simple project
    - simple database design
    - simple logics
    - simple user interface
    - simple system architecture
- all the new approach details is in the other document
- anyhow, i realize something. i can do my best work in silent environment
    - silent is where i can focus do my thing
    - music or other sound is a distraction - total distraction
    - so, no more background music, no more background video if i want to complete
    this simple project or any other thing for that matter
    - what i need is only the 'work' sound. sound that related or produced during
    working with it - for example: sound of keyboard, etc..
