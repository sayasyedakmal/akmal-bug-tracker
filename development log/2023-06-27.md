## What I've learned
- Linking and Navigation
    - link change our life
    - anchor tag - a element
        - href attribute
        - inline element
        - can also wrap image
        - group of things can be a link
        - absolute URL - specific URL
        - HTPPS is needed
        - HTTP vs HTTPS - S is Secure
        - every website should be using HTTPS
    - same site and same domain name - relative URL
    - local copy
    - relative URL can be use to link to ther resources/files
    - directory and folders
    - index.html - default file name for any folder
    - craft the URL - how you want the URL looks like to the user
    - relative URL can be useful if the web need to move to other server during development - it will not point to the actual domain instead it look for local copy
    - navigation
    - menu and navigation bar
    - nav element - major navigation links
    - attributes - role="navigation" - ARIA role
        - aria-label attribute
- images and graphics
    - image element - img tag
    - 4 attribute - src, alt, width and height
    - every img should have those 4 attributes
    - alt attribute - when the image cannot be seen - screen reader will read it
        - use alt and make it empty so that browser will not read it
        - use alt when you want to say why the image is there
        - no need to put value for alt if the image does not have meaning or we dont want screen reader reads it out loud
    - width and height attribute - number only - it will be pixels
        - if we set these values, browser will pre calculate the layout - recommended - browser will have headstart
            - if we set it, the page layout will not jumping around as the image loaded. if not, the layout will jumping around as the image loaded
        - if dont set it, it will download and read the image size and then calculate the layout
    - image format
    - image file - format
        - GIF - oldest - large area of single color - limited color spaces - retro look - animated gif
        - SVG - vector file - instruction for drawing - vector and math - can scale - wont be pixelated - very small size - use SVG if you can - scalable vector graphics - can be program - can be exported from software like Illustrator, Sketch and other vector graphics program
        - JPG - great compressing photos - compress before using on the web - original size is big - when compress for the web, great way to deliver great photos
        - PNG - use when need transperarency
    - there will be new image format in the future - be aware
    - when compressing, try several options - tune the settings as much as possible
    - objectives: small file size - to download fast as possible
    - responsive images
    - CSS can change the size
    - HTML to deliver different image size for different screen
    - set the image for certain size and let the browser download which one
    - create multiple copy of our image and let the browser know
    - srcset attribute for img element - it will have a list of image source and the multiplier - browser then decide which one to display - 1x, 2x
    - responsive width
    - based on the layout size
    - srcset attribute - 480w - 960w
    - 100% viewport width
    - sizes attribute - listing which image size based on the viewport size
    - refer the video again if you need a refresher later
